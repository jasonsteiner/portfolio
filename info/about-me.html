  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Hello! I'm Jason, and I live in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Currently, I attend Cornell University as a Computer Science major with an expected graduation date of May 2024.</p>
  <p>I'm interested in software solutions that are scalable and apply to business problems, and through an extensive background in programming and mathematics, I bring an algorithmic yet creative approach to problem-solving.</p>
  <p>Outside of the classroom, I'm heavily involved in music. A violinist, I am Assistant Concertmaster of the Cornell Symphony Orchestra, participate in year-round chamber groups, and take lessons privately with Dr. Ariana Kim. I love to play basketball with friends, and I'm an avid runner!</p>
  <p>Please reach out! I can be contacted at jns226@cornell.edu and would be happy to chat, grab a coffee, or anything the like!</p>
